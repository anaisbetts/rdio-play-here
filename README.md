# Rdio Play Here

So. I've got a computer and a phone:

</div>

and since I subscribe to this:

I want to listen to the music on the **computer** with the good speakers but control it with the **phone** which doesn't (substitute "phone" with "laptop" at times).

## Doesn't Rdio already do this?

Yes! Rdio lets you remote control an **already playing** Rdio player. But that bold part is the catch: if I want to send music to my desktop computer attached to the nice speakers, I have to remote into it, hit Play, and only *then* can I control the tunes from my phone / laptop.

## Rdio Play Here: Send Rdio to any computer with an open Chrome Browser

Rdio Play Here is a combination of a Chrome Extension (so it works everywhere Automagicallyâ„¢) and a website. Here's a mockup of the website. Super simple: if you click that machine, it sends a message to the browser running on that machine to double-tap the Play button, which will make it the currently playing Rdio, and all of the other open Rdio instances (like on your phone) will become remote controls.
